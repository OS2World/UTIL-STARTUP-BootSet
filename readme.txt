What is BootSet ?
------------------
BootSet allow batchfiles (batchcommands) to be run during the OS/2 boot-
sequence. BootSet is normally run before the graphic part of OS/2 (PM/WPS)
is loaded and therefore allows you to perform tasks that is not possible when
PM/WPS is loaded, ie. replacing systemfiles like DLL-files, drivers and
config.sys.

Optionally you may use BootSet to select different startup configurations
using the reboot feature of BootSet.

BootSet is built to support the smallest OS/2 configurations. You do not
need WPS nor PM to install/modify/run BootSet. BootSet might not be a
flashy PM program but does its job using very little system resources.


Requirements:
--------------
BootSet requires IBM OS/2 2.0 or later.
It has been sucessfully tested on OS/2 2.11, OS/2 Warp 3.0, 
OS/2 Warp Connect and  OS/2 Warp 4.0 (Merlin).
Bootset will also run on OS/2 Warp Server and OS/2 Lan Server.

BootSet will NOT work on IBM OS/2 Warp 3 with Fixpack 17 till fixpack 21 due
to a bug in these fixpacks. 

To be able to reboot BootSet its also required that the DOS.SYS device driver 
is loaded. This is normally done when installing the DOS support in OS/2.

Note: Bootset does not use DOS, it just happens to use a driver that is 
also used by the DOS support.


Installation:
--------------

Automatic installation:-------------------------------------------
Copy all the files into a temporary directory.

Start the installation program (INSTALL.EXE)
Change the path (if needed) and press F2 to start the installation.
BootSet will now be installed.
If you selected to allow BootSet to change CONFIG.SYS the old CONFIG.SYS
file will be saved as CONFIG.BAK. If you did not allow BootSet to change
CONFIG.SYS the changes will be recorded in the CONFIG.NEW file.
CONFIG.SYS must be changed in order to work.


Manual installation:---------------------------------------------
Copy the files to a directory of your choice. You may install BootSet in any
directory that you wish. The only files needed is the .EXE file (BOOTSET.EXE)
and its .SET file.
The file BOOTSET.SET is an example of how a .SET file can look. 
We recommend you to edit the file before you use it.

You must now also add the following line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

CALL=C:\BOOTSET\BOOTSET.EXE C:\BOOTSET\BOOTSET.SET

Where the first statement after CALL= is the full path and name of the
executable file and the second statement is the full path and name of the
INI-file.

The position of this line in your CONFIG.SYS file is arbitary since OS/2 does
not load the lines one after one but runs them in its own specific order. 
The lines starting with CALL are among the last to run.
